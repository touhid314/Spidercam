# Spidercam With Live Camera Stream

[This project was done as part of the EEE318 Control Systems Laboratory of Level 3, Term 2]
The project features a spidercam system with live streaming camera with a web interface. For the spidercam 3D maneuver, 2 Arduinos have been used as the microcontroller to precisely control 4 stepper motors. ESP32 camera module has been used for live streaming and an asynchronous TCP web server has been programmed into the ESP32 controller. An HTML/JavaScript based web interface has been made for wireless live stream of the camera feed.
